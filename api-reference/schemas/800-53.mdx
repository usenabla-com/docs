## Overview

NIST Special Publication 800-53 Revision 5 provides a comprehensive catalog of security and privacy controls for information systems and organizations. Nabla's automated assessment analyzes your infrastructure-as-code (IaC) to evaluate compliance against key NIST 800-53 controls.

## Framework Details

- **Framework**: NIST 800-53
- **Version**: Revision 5
- **Baseline**: Moderate (expandable to Low/High)
- **Output Format**: OSCAL Assessment Results (JSON)

## Assessed Control Families

### Access Control (AC)

| Control | Title | Assessment Method |
|---------|-------|-------------------|
| AC-2 | Account Management | Detects IAM users, roles, and groups |
| AC-3 | Access Enforcement | Evaluates IAM policies and security groups |
| AC-4 | Information Flow Enforcement | Analyzes network controls (VPCs, subnets, NACLs) |
| AC-6 | Least Privilege | Identifies overly permissive wildcard (*) policies |

### Audit and Accountability (AU)

| Control | Title | Assessment Method |
|---------|-------|-------------------|

| IA-5 | Authenticator Management | Detects access keys, login profiles, Cognito domains |

### System and Communications Protection (SC)

| Control | Title | Assessment Method |
|---------|-------|-------------------|
| SC-7 | Boundary Protection | Evaluates security groups, NACLs, VPCs |
| SC-8 | Transmission Confidentiality | Verifies HTTPS listeners, S3 encryption in transit |
| SC-13 | Cryptographic Protection | Identifies KMS keys and encryption mechanisms |

### System and Information Integrity (SI)

| Control | Title | Assessment Method |
|---------|-------|-------------------|
| SI-4 | System Monitoring | Detects CloudWatch, GuardDuty, AWS Config |

## Evidence Collection

The assessor automatically extracts evidence from your infrastructure resources:

```json
{
  "evidence": [
    "IAM resource: aws_iam_user.admin",
    "Access control resource: aws_security_group.web_tier",
    "Logging resource: aws_cloudtrail.main",
    "Encryption key: aws_kms_key.data_key"
  ]
}
```

## Compliance Status

Each control is assigned one of three statuses:

- **Satisfied**: Required controls are properly configured
- **NotSatisfied**: Controls are missing or misconfigured
- **NotApplicable**: Control cannot be assessed from IaC

## Current Infrastructure Coverage

<Note>
**AWS-First Approach**: The current implementation focuses on AWS resources as a starting point. We are actively expanding support for:
- Azure (azurerm_* resources)
- Google Cloud Platform (google_* resources)
- Kubernetes and container infrastructure
- Multi-cloud architectures

If you have specific resource types you'd like to see supported, please reach out to our team.
</Note>

### Supported AWS Resources

The assessor currently recognizes these AWS resource types:

**Identity & Access Management**
- `aws_iam_user`, `aws_iam_role`, `aws_iam_group`
- `aws_iam_policy`, `aws_iam_role_policy`, `aws_iam_policy_attachment`
- `aws_iam_access_key`, `aws_iam_user_login_profile`
- `aws_cognito_user_pool`, `aws_cognito_user_pool_domain`

**Networking**
- `aws_vpc`, `aws_subnet`, `aws_route_table`
- `aws_security_group`, `aws_network_acl`

**Logging & Monitoring**
- `aws_cloudtrail`, `aws_cloudwatch_log_group`, `aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm`
- `aws_s3_bucket_logging`, `aws_flow_log`
- `aws_guardduty_detector`, `aws_config_configuration_recorder`

**Encryption & Key Management**
- `aws_kms_key`, `aws_kms_alias`
- `aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration`

**Backup & Recovery**
- `aws_backup_vault`, `aws_backup_plan`
- `aws_db_instance` (backup retention checks)

**Load Balancing & Traffic**
- `aws_lb_listener`, `aws_alb_listener`

## OSCAL Output Structure

Assessment results are returned in OSCAL 1.0.4 format:

```json
{
  "assessment-results": {
    "uuid": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "metadata": {
      "title": "Nabla NIST 800-53 Assessment",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "oscal-version": "1.0.4"
    },
    "results": [{
      "title": "NIST 800-53 IaC Assessment",
      "observations": [...],
      "findings": [...],
      "reviewed-controls": {
        "control-selections": [{
          "include-controls": [
            { "control-id": "AC-2" },
            { "control-id": "AC-3" }
          ]
        }]
      }
    }]
  }
}
```

## Example Assessment

```bash
    curl --request POST \
        --url https://api.usenabla.com/v1/fedramp \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --header 'X-Customer-Key: <x-customer-key>' \
        --data '{
        "name": "<string>",
        "format": "oscal",
        "source_type": "terraform_state",
        "source_content": "<string>",
    }'
```

## Interpreting Results

### Satisfied Controls
Controls marked as **Satisfied** indicate that:
- Required infrastructure resources are present
- Security configurations meet baseline requirements
- Evidence was successfully extracted from IaC

### Not Satisfied Controls
Controls marked as **NotSatisfied** may indicate:
- Missing security controls (e.g., no CloudTrail logging)
- Misconfigured resources (e.g., overly permissive IAM policies)
- Weak cryptographic implementations

### Findings
Each finding includes:
- **Control ID**: Which control failed
- **Description**: What issue was detected
- **Related Observations**: Links to specific evidence

## Limitations

<Warning>
This automated assessment has important limitations:
- **IaC-Only Analysis**: Only evaluates resources defined in Terraform/IaC
- **Runtime Behavior**: Cannot assess operational security practices
- **Organizational Controls**: Some controls (e.g., security training) require manual assessment
- **AWS-Focused**: Currently optimized for AWS resources (expanding to multi-cloud)
</Warning>

## Best Practices

1. **Combine with Manual Assessment**: Use automated results as a starting point, not a complete assessment
2. **Review Findings**: Each finding should be investigated in context of your architecture
3. **Track Over Time**: Run assessments regularly to monitor compliance posture
4. **Supplement with Runtime Evidence**: Consider integrating runtime security scanning
